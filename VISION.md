# Vision – I.R.I.S.

I.R.I.S. exists to prove one thing:

> **AI image generation does not belong exclusively to corporations.**

---

## 🌍 The Problem

Most AI platforms:
- Lock users into subscriptions
- Hide implementation details
- Require cloud dependency
- Limit customization
- Collect user data

---

## 🌱 Our Vision

I.R.I.S. is a **reference architecture**, not a walled product.

- Anyone can run it — on any hardware
- Anyone can modify it — no restrictions
- Anyone can scale it — from laptop to datacenter
- Anyone can learn from it — fully documented

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

### Local-First
Your images, your hardware, your data. Nothing leaves your machine unless you choose to share it.

### Open by Default
Every line of code is visible. Every decision is documented. Every feature is modifiable.

### Hardware-Agnostic
NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon, or CPU — I.R.I.S. adapts to what you have, not what vendors want you to buy.

### Community-Driven
Built by developers, for developers. Contributions welcome, forks encouraged.

## 🎯 Design Principles

1. **Simplicity over complexity** — Easy to understand, easy to modify
2. **Modularity over monoliths** — Replace any component without breaking others
3. **Performance over features** — Works on a GTX 1650, scales to RTX 4090
4. **Privacy over convenience** — No telemetry, no tracking, no cloud dependency

---

## 🚀 The Long-Term Goal

To become the **foundation layer** upon which:
- Individual creators build their workflows
- Studios deploy internal tools
- Researchers experiment freely
- Communities share and collaborate

---

## 🔮 What I.R.I.S. Will Never Be

- A subscription service
- A data collection platform
- A vendor-locked ecosystem
- A black box

---

I.R.I.S. is not finished.  
It is **alive** — growing with every contribution.

**Version 1.0.0** marks the beginning, not the end.
